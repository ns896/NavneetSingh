          <h2> 2.0 System Overview</h2>
          <p>
              INA3221 is used to measure the various voltages and also performs the analog to digital conversion for the 
              various systems measurements that are needed for the power monitoring and supervision purpose.
              Various native measurements that are performed on the INA3221 IC itself are Bus_Voltage, Shunt_Voltage and Shunt_Voltage_Sum.
              <br><br>
              The <b>Bus_Voltage</b> is simply a ADC reading on the IN_1,IN_2,IN_3 pins of the INA3221 IC. This bus voltage can only go
              26_Volts on that pin. This voltage can be measured with a accuracy of 8mV, this is driven by the ADC of the INA3221.
              <br><br>
              The <b>Shunt_Voltage</b> is a difference voltage reading on the two ends of the SHUNT_Resistor. Voltage measurements 
              on pins  VIN+1__VIN-1, VIN+2__VIN-2, VIN+3__VIN-3. The voltage difference and the accurate value of resistance can 
              be used to calculate the current flowing through that rail.
              <br><br>
              The per channel voltages can be summed up or averaged by the INA3221 FSM itself. The configration register space 11-9 bit, can be used to define how many
              samples are summed up to make a valid reading. Values include 1,4,16,64,128,1024. Default value is 1, I have not played with it much to see the effect.
              But the mathematical implications are Lower Noise and Accuracy improvement.
              <br><br>
              The INA3221 communicates with the MCU on the I2C bus. The max operating frequency for the SCL line is 2.44MHz. This is 
              only the case for the high speed mode which needs a repeated start condition for entering a high speed communication mode.
              in Fast/Normal mode the maximum frequency of communication is not more then 0.4MHz(400Khz).

        <h3>2.1 INA3221 BUS Voltage Measurements</h3>
        <p>
            The BUS_VOLTAGE is stored in the register space at addresses 0x02, 0x04, and 0x06 for the respective channels. To convert the ADC digital reading to a floating-point value, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right shift the ADC reading by 3 bits.</li>
            <li>Multiply the result by 8mV to obtain the absolute voltage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.0 STM32H7 Data Flow</h3>
        <p>
          The Firmware on STM32H7 is responsible for sending the data from the MCU to the main PC, on the UART bus.
          The BAUD RATE of the UART is 115200 Bits/second (needed to set up the host).

        <h4> 3.1 UART PACKET ENCODING </h4>
        <p>
        The data coming out of the MCU will be in a form of data packets. 
        Protocol that will be followed by the sender will be as follows.<br><br>

        SOF -> Data_0.1 -> Data_0.2 -> Data_1.0 -> Data_1.2 ......... -> EOF
        Each data packet is consisting of 16 bits of channel data. The protocol will have 6 channels, three for shut voltage
        and three for bus voltage.

          SOF/EOF Conflict Resolution When the data to be transmitted conflicts with the Start of Frame (SOF) 
          or End of Frame (EOF) bytes, we will use a byte stuffing option. A special character will be transmitted 
          before the conflicting byte, which will be an XOR of the conflict byte with the special character.<br>
          * Special Character: 0x1B <br><br>

        <h3>5.0 Hardware Design & Constrains</h3>
        <p>
          The hardware part of the design can be divided into two subsections, part onw which deals with the 
          implementation of INA3221 IC and the surrounding support needed by it, i.e. power supply, shunt resistors
          and decoupling caps. 
          The second part of the hardware design is the implementation of the ARM MCU and its connection to the 
          INA3221. for this implementation I am using the ARM development board from STM32H7.

        <p>
          The following schematic board is used foe the implementation of the current sensor.<br><br>
          In the following board implementation the A0 pin of the INA3221 is tied to GND hence the device address 
          is 0b1000000. This value is used to address the slave over the I2C bus.
