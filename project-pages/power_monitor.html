            This power monitoring system leverages the capabilities of the INA3221 power monitor supervisor IC. 
            It can measure voltage rails relative to GND and the shunt voltage across a shunt resistor, which can be 
            translated by an MCU into current consumption values for each voltage rail. Additionally, the system includes various
            alert and supervisor functions that can be configured to provide protection for circuits, ensuring robust and reliable 
            power management.
            <br><br>          
            The data rail voltage and rail current consumption on each rail is preprocessed on the STM32, and then compressed into
            packets which are then provided to the Host over a UART communication lines. A TUI written for this is used to visualize
            the data coming from the sensor.

        <h2> 1.0 Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This power monitoring system leverages the capabilities of the INA3221 power monitor supervisor IC.
            It can measure voltage rails relative to GND, thus providing the absolute rail voltage and also the shunt voltage across a shunt resistor, which can be
            translated by an MCU into current consumption values for each voltage rail. Additionally, the system includes various
            alert and supervisor functions that can be configured to provide protection for circuits, ensuring robust and reliable
            power management.

          <h2> 2.0 System Overview</h2>
          <p>
              INA3221 is used to measure the various voltages and also performs the analog to digital conversion for the 
              various systems measurements that are needed for the power monitoring and supervision purpose.
              Various native measurements that are performed on the INA3221 IC itself are Bus_Voltage, Shunt_Voltage and Shunt_Voltage_Sum.
              <br><br>
              The <b>Bus_Voltage</b> is simply a ADC reading on the IN_1,IN_2,IN_3 pins of the INA3221 IC. This bus voltage can only go
              26_Volts on that pin. This voltage can be measured with a accuracy of 8mV, this is driven by the ADC of the INA3221.
              <br><br>
              The <b>Shunt_Voltage</b> is a difference voltage reading on the two ends of the SHUNT_Resistor. Voltage measurements 
              on pins  VIN+1__VIN-1, VIN+2__VIN-2, VIN+3__VIN-3. The voltage difference and the accurate value of resistance can 
              be used to calculate the current flowing through that rail.
